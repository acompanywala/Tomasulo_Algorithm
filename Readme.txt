The project includes a Makefile which builds binary in the project's root
directory named procsim. The program should run from this root directory as:
./procsim –r R –f F –j J –k K –l L < trace_file

The command line parameters are as follows:
• F – Fetch rate (instructions per cycle)
• J – Number of k0 function units
• K – Number of k1 function units
• L – Number of k2 function units
• R – Result buses
• trace_file – Path name to the trace file
